<!--ODIN - The Online Database of Interlinear Text-->
<!--The results presented here represent data found on the Web that contain suspected instances of Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT).  Misidentifications are possible.-->
<!--For those results that indicate Verified as 'Highest' or 'High', all instances of IGT in the document have been manually verified both to be IGT and to be in the language specified. Highest verification indicates that the results suffered no corruption in the extraction process. 'Auto' indicates that these data were added through an automated process without supervision. 'Low' indicates that the language was not verified, although the instances discovered are IGT.-->
<!--Funding for ODIN has been provided by the Data-Driven Linguistics Ontology grant (NSF BCS #0411348), the EMELD grant (NSF ITR #0094934), and the California State University, Fresno.-->
