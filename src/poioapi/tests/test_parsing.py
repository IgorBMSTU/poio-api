""" This module is to test all the parsing modules
and methods that PoioAPI parser uses. Including the
parser to the three data hierarchies, GRAID,
MORPHSYN and WORD.

Note: This module it'll test the modules that
generates a XML file.
In order to drive this test the pickle file used is
the Balochi Text1.pickle.

    """
    This class contain the test methods to the classes
    that parse the elements from a data structure
    hierarchy to a XML file which means to the GrAF.

    The test describe in this class can be used for the
    parsing of comments, translation and the creation of
    the raw file. Although is need to change some of
    the code lines. Thoses lines are the file_parsed is
    need to change the suffix to e. g. '-translation'.
    This is because of the retrieving process of the
    data hierarchy structures be identical in the three
    existing ones.
    The same will work to the rest of the elements in the
    data hierarchy. E. g. in Morph data structure the
    element word will generate a file with a suffix '-word'
    to the original file name or in GRAID structure graid1
    generate a '-graid1' suffix.

    Note: Is important to know that the suffix depends
    on the names that the structures of the Annotation Tree
    have.
